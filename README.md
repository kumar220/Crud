# Crud
Mean stack crud application

Here a user can enter their user name, name and their employee id from the form and submit the form. If the values are incorrect, then form will validate at the frontend and form will not submit. If all the values seem perfect, then it will send the form to backend API, and it will store the values inside the MongoDB database.
